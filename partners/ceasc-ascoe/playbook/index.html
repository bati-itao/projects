	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<h3>Who we are</h3>
	<h4>The Centre of Expertise for Accessible Client Service</h4>
	<p>We work for Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). Our small team is part of the Strategic Directions Directorate in Citizen Service Branch.</p>
	<p> We have built our capacity to better understand the reality of how people live with a disability, and the service barriers that create a challenge when trying to access government programs and services.</p>
	<h5>Our mandate</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Conduct research to improve our understanding of the service barriers</li>
		<li>Provide advice to programs and service delivery channels</li>
		<li>Lead initiatives to improve accessibility of programs and service delivery</li>
		<li>Share best practices and learn from others</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>How to reach us</h5>

	<h3>Our story behind the Playbook</h3>
	<p>The AccessAbility Playbook is part of a broader commitment to make Canada's public service the most accessible and inclusive in the world.</p>
	<p> This is our way to engage and share with others what we know about accessibility in client service. We hope this is the start of many conversations. By reading this, you are one step closer to making this possible.</p>
	<p> In July 2019, the Government of Canada enacted the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-0.6/"><em>Accessible Canada Act</em></a>. The Act requires government departments to increase the inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities or functional limitations, including when designing and delivering programs and services.</p>
	<p> The Office of Public Service Accessibility launched a government-wide strategy titled: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc.html"><em>Nothing without us</em></a>. This Playbook contributes to Goal 4 "Equip public servants to design and deliver accessible programs and services".</p>
	<p> ESDC developed a Roadmap to Improve Accessible Client Service. The Roadmap proposed various accessibility solutions for the Department to adopt and make improvements on how persons with disabilities access ESDC programs and services.</p>
	<p> The Centre of Expertise (CoE) for Accessible Client Service was a key recommendation identified in the Roadmap.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#">Play 1: Learn about accessibility, it’s more than you think</a></h3>
                    <p>Over the years, many decisions were made to better serve Canadians. However, some of these decisions might have created obstacles that make it difficult, or even sometimes impossible, for persons with disabilities to access government programs and services.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">
                    <h3><a href="#">Play 2: Understand how barriers affect persons with disabilities</a></h3>
                    <p>Many in this client group have visible disabilities. It is important to keep proper accessibility measures up to date, well understood, tested and maintained for functionality. Any improvements should go beyond the building codes and standards. For example, make it a business requirement to have service centres located near public transit, have parking close to the main entrance and test automatic door openers each day as part of standard procedures. This can help ensure the clients have a positive experience, even before they interact with your employees. Enable clients to get to your office and move around easily by having ramps where necessary, wide hallways and doorways, and accessible washrooms. Also think about integrating multi-level counters as part of your interior design standards.</p>

                <section class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">
                    <h3><a href="#">Play 3: Involve persons with disabilities from the start</a></h3>
                    <p>When you conduct research and user testing (UX), partner with organizations that can introduce you to people with disabilities willing to participate and offer feedback. You will then discover insights you won’t gain from reading accessibility standards documentation — like how to create a great client experience (CX) for anyone with permanent, situational, or temporary physical or cognitive challenges.</p>

                <section class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">
                    <h3><a href="#">Play 4: Design experiences to be more inclusive</a></h3>
                    <p>Universal design is an approach to intentionally design and deliver programs and services without creating barriers. While it helps ensure inclusion of persons with disabilities, it is seen as good design practice that meets the needs of anyone who needs to access your programs and services.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#">Play 5: Make communications accessible for everyone</a></h3>
                    <p>To communicate in plain language doesn't mean over-simplifying or leaving out critical information. When you use plain language, it actually makes critical information accessible and understandable for everyone.</p>

                <section class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">

                    <p>Have patience and be accommodating. For example, recognize there may be a need to repeat information.</p>

                <section class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">
                    <h3><a href="#">Play 7: Be part of an accessible culture</a></h3>
                    <p><strong>Be an ally.</strong> When you witness policies or practices that go against accessibility principles, don’t be afraid to raise the issues or question the status quo. Don’t be afraid to suggest new ways of doing things.</p>
